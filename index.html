    <center><h2>Background</h2></center>
    <p>Sustainable living refers to a lifestyle that aims to reduce an individual’s or community’s environmental impact, conserve resources, and promote ecological balance. It encompasses choices in daily life that minimize the negative effects on the planet, promoting the health of both people and the environment for current and future generations. The concept draws from the broader idea of sustainability, which involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The roots of sustainable living can be traced back to the environmental movement of the mid-20th century, which responded to increasing concerns over pollution, resource depletion, and climate change. The 1987 Brundtland Report, officially known as the Our Common Future report, played a key role in shaping modern sustainability practices by defining sustainability as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."</p>
