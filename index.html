    <center><h2>Background</h2></center>
    <center><p>Sustainable living is a lifestyle aimed at reducing an individual’s or community’s environmental impact by minimizing resource consumption and waste. It involves adopting practices like conserving energy, using renewable resources, and choosing eco-friendly products to protect natural ecosystems. Sustainable living often emphasizes the "three Rs": reduce, reuse, and recycle, alongside practices such as supporting local economies and growing or sourcing organic food. It is driven by a commitment to combat climate change, preserve biodiversity, and ensure resources are available for future generations. Ultimately, it seeks to balance the needs of people, the planet, and prosperity in a harmonious and responsible way.</p></center>
